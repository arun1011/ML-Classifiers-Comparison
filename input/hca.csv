Her earlier N/V issues late last year where clearly due to poorly controlled migraines and how she was treating them. She had a period of improved health of 6 months with improved migraine control.

"Free Text A&P: HPI: Peter Petrone is a 4 month old M with hx of reflux who presents after a BRUE. Parents heard pt gasping for air around 3 AM and went to his crib. Pt sleeps in a ""rock n play"" due to his reflux. Mother lifted him from the crib and noticed he felt like ""dead weight"". The pt was shaking slightly for approximately 10 sec and then calmed down. The room was dark so mother was unable to tell if pt appeared blue when she got to him. Infant uses ""Owlet Monitor"" at home which mother states monitors HR and oxygen and will alarm if these are low after about 2 min. Mother does report that there have been more difficulties feeding the pt lately. She has noticed some decreased appetite and increase in his spitting up. Pt takes 5-7oz Alimentum every 3-4 hrs. He is prescribed Prevacid 2.5 ml daily and has been taking it for ~2 months. He was first tried on Zantac but mother did not think that medication was helping so switched to Prevacid. Parents were both sick a few weeks ago with stomach virus. Infant was seen by his pediatrician on day of admission. Pediatrician told parents that the episode they witnessed early that morning was likely a BRUE which could be due to reflux, but that the pt could be admitted to the hospital for monitoring and work up. The parents agreed that they would like the pt to be admitted to the hospital, so he was taken for direct admission to the PWH PICU for further management. 12/14/16: Pt NPO at 4AM for Upper GI series today which was unremarkable. Discussed risks and benefits of pH probe and testing for seizures with parents and they do not feel pt needs work up at this time. They are comfortable taking pt home once they receive home apnea monitor.

CT scan on admission revealed an inflammatory/infectious process sorrounding terminal cecum with a normal appendix. Patient being managed conservatively with NPO, IVF's, IV pain medication, Cipro/Flagyl, and being monitored for response to therapy. patient evaluated this morning and found to be in persistent and grossly unchanged pain, but NAD. VS stable and within normal limits overnight. Labs this morning show favorable normalization of WBC in response to antibiotic therapy, and presumably, improved inflammation. On exam, patient continues to be exquisitely tender to palpation at RLQ, although no longer tender at LLQ. At this time, surgery team is not sure as to underlying cause for inflammation/infection around cecum as patient has no family history, or personal history of PID, diverticulosis, or any systemic symptoms suggestive of GI abnormalities. CT scan repeated and after discussion with radiology, we agreed scan appears to show organization or previous stranding and fluid collection most likely suggesting initial abscess formation. As to the etiology of this infection, we believe the diagnosis is possibly microperforation from diverticulum vs epiploic appendigitis vs omental infarction. We will continue to treat conservatively with antibiotics and monitor for response. If patient does feel better tomorrow, will start trial of PO fluids.

Now with improving ANC to 170 today. #N/V: Typhlitis vs MMF toxicity vs resolving gastroenteritis vs IBS vs IBD. Previous workup last week negative for infectious etiology (C.

Possibly due to evolving sequelae from Rituximab, MMF, or Hydroxychloroquine. Admitting team discussed this with her rheumatologist Dr. Saketkoo who is concerned that there is something else causing her pancytopenia such as infection-- however it is not clear that Dr. Sakektoo was aware of the recent Rituximab dosing when this patient was discussed on admission. May also have GI bleed contributing to her anemia as Ms. Lewis has seen stool flecked with blood in past and her last FOBT was positive on 5/3. - Heme/Onc following-- recommends holding on Hydroxycloroquine at this time. - Per Dr Satketoo will hold Hydroxycloroquine for now and check CMV, EBV, Parvo, HIV - Dr Saketoo would like to hold off on bone marrow biopsy for now. May need to consider H/O consult in the future - Neutropenic precautions #SIRS: Technically met SIRS criteria with leukopenia and tachycardia at admit. However, her leukopenia is chronic and her tachycardia was likely secondary to hypovolemia since it resolved with IVF. Although she may have a GI infection she does not appear to be septic.

Previous workup last week negative for infectious etiology (C. Diff), and appeared to improve throughout hospitalization. Attributed to MMF toxicity at that time. Patient discharged on 5/3 due to stated desire to leave the hospital and attend prom. Abdominal pain and diarrhea have not improved despite discontinuing MMF. Now with imaging showing small and large bowel wall thickening, though no evidence of pneumatosis coli. Contrast was not used due to CKD. Lactic acid normal. Also, worsened ANC with absolute neutrophil count of 0.04. -Continue|VF125ml's/hr -Continue Zosyn due to concern for Typhlitis -Surgery consulted-- appreciate recs. -KUB with oral contrast performed this morning #Pancytopenia: ANC down to 100 from 444 on 5/3--> now further decreased to 40. Hb low this AM at 6.2--> received 1U PRBC's last night. Platelets also down to 69 from 87-100 |ast admit. Possibly due to evolving sequelae from Rituximab or Hydroxychloroquine. Admitting team discussed this with her rheumatologist Dr. Saketkoo who is concerned that there is something else causing her pancytopenia such as infection. May also have GI bleed contributing to her anemia as Ms. Lewis has seen stoo| flecked with blood in past and her last FOBT was positive on 5/3. -Wi|l continue to Monitor -G| would like to scope once no longer neutropenic - Per Dr Satketoo will hold Hydroxycloroquine for now and check CMV, EBV, Parvo, HIV - Dr Saketoo would like to hold off on bone marrow biopsy for now. May need to consider H/O consult in the future - Neutropenic precautions #SIRS: technically meets SIRS criteria with leukopenia and tachycardia at admit. However, her leukopenia is chronic and her tachycardia was likely secondary to hypovolemia since it resolved with IVF. Although she may have a GI infection she does not appear to be septic. #AKI: Cr 2.8 this morning. Baseline approximately 2.0-2.5.

While he does typically eat soft or pureed foods, will plan on providing majority of calories by formula with the intent he can continue to eat small amounts of soft/pureed foods. Mom states they were feeding him around 2,000 kcal a day before. Page 4 of 5 , Patient: SEAY DE YOUNG,AUSTIN JACK Unit#:D002234727 Date: 10/06/16 Acct#:D00114397664 Started on feeds of Pediasure and gradually advanced to 4 oz Q4. Tolerating well. Tried advancing to 8 oz + 4 oz water flush GT QID. Total fluid goal of at least 1500 cc/day. On evening of 10/4, had a large emesis following a feeding of Pedisure 802 + 402 water. Afterwards, became irritable and tachycardic, and then had a fever overnight to 103. Feeds were backed down to 4 oz QID. Stepfather prefers higher calorie goal for now and given the fact the hospital does not carry any reduced calorie formulas, will continue with Pediasure for now. Has h/o erosive esophagitis and noted yesterday to have formula in mouth suggesting ongoing reflux. While option of GES was discussed with parents, it was decided to go ahead and start on treatment with EES (30 mins before feedings) as prokinetic on 10/5. Remains on PPI (now Prevacid suspension through G-tube). According to the stepfather, the EES seems to be helping with patient's GERD symptoms and feeds. Feeds advanced to 8 oz this am and tolerated well. Had previously discussed the possibility of using a enteral feeding pump in order to administer daytime feeds and nighttime drip feeds if necessary. Mother reportedly is interested in giving some blended foods through G-tube. Might be candidate for blended foods during daytime, and Pediasure at night as drip feeds. Again had discussed the possibility of converting G-tube to GJ-tube in the future if ongoing issue with GERD and/or feeding intolerance. Parent have attended class for G-tube cares. Discharge coordinator to arrange for home health for G-tube supplies and formula. Asked parent to stop by our office after discharge for baseline weight measurement. Will schedule follow appointment with dietician in our office in 1-2 weeks. Already has appointment with me on 11/7/16. Discussed with parent and Peds team.

Review of CT from Jackson with Dr. Sheline demonstrates the area of concern but does not demonstrate a small bowel volvulus. Specifically the images here as well as those on CT scan do not show a bowel obstruction or abnormal bowel gas pattern. The contrast from the limited UGI has traversed into the colon and shows a completely normal ileocecal junction making volvulus and malrotation extremely unlikely. The images do show significant stool. All labs were normal except for mild dehydration that corrected with IV hydration overnight.

"Problem List/A&P: 1. Acquired complex cyst of kidney l have reviewed yesterdays RUQ US as well as the CT from 9/19/2016 with radiologist today. US yesterday only looked at right kidney which appears normal, possibly a small simple cyst. CT showed what is likely multiple LLP renal cysts, some septations and probably represents a mildly complex Bosnack Class II cyst. We agreed that a CT with contrast should be performed to confirm finding as this appears unlikely to be a cystic RCC. Free Text A&P: Patient has a reported 20+ year h/o a right renal cyst. CT suggested a 7 cm multi-loculated right renal cyst but US today did not redomonstrate this. Cyst appears much smaller and less complex.

Differential diagnosis from gastroenterology notes reviewed 08/02/16--rounds [C.-modified]—-Patient very upset with the nursing staff last night regarding difficulty to interpret the HIDA scan results. Basically the first HIDA scan was non-completed and the study had to be repeated. The followup HIDA scan was negative. Relayed this to the patient. She is demanding discharge home today Tuesday. The plan of action --her HIDA scan has postponed the gastric motility study until tomorrow [Wednesday]. My understanding is this is because of the residual isotope. Explained to the patient that should she go home there is no reason to expect anything except recurrent cyclic nausea and vomiting which has been her outpatient pattern now for months & months and months and has resulted in admission after admission after admission. Advised against discharge because it would more than likely result in only readmission because the cause of her disorder has still not been clearly identified so no clear Rx option has been solidified. However I advised the patient ,The decision is hers and she is allowed to leave the hospital & by simply signing AMA We would be in agreement. However she understands that I am against leaving prematurely without a gastric motility study results And I would not be responsible are involved in her care after she leaves.|nitially the patient chose to sign out AMA and the forms were printed and she then decided not to sign out AMA and reported her grandmother would take care of her family members that her mother was out of town and unavailable and her boyfriend was working. I was then later notified she wished to transfer her case to Dr. DeLeon. I contacted the nursing staff and Dr. DeLeon's coverage service ""the hospitalist "" Contacted me. Case was discussed transfer was in agreement to the hospitalists and the transfer of care was completed.

Anxiety Free Text A&P: 28 year old woman, admitted with acute onset of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea x 1 day, hx of Crohn's disease just started on biologic therapy. Pt does not appear acutely ill as she did in Sept '15 when she presented with an exacerbation of Crohn's disease. First loading dose of Humira given 11 days ago. Sick contacts in home, similar GI sxs, now learning her young son has same, making viral gastroenteritis much more likely working diagnosis now. There is no objective evidence of bowel obstruction (abd series done 2 days ago), no lab abnormalities to suggest an acute bacterial illness or significant dehydration. No indication for steroids or abx. Today, multiple events have occured on the nursing floor prompting multiple updates to our service and hospitalist. Pt claimed to have fallen onto the floor having had fecal incontinence while down, however when pt phoned her RN pt was found to be in the bed, bed alarm had not sounded alert, no evidence of injury, no evidence of urine, stool or emesis on the floor. Pt reports constant dry heaving, no witnessed emesis in any measureable volume today. Pt has not taken any food today. Pt asked RN to inform us of her request for resumption of dilaudid and phenergan and also request for 2nd GI opinion. I saw the pt this afternoon after all above events and requests.

AKERMAN,STUART MD 12/02/15 1629: Diagnosis, Assessment & Plan Supervising Physician Note: _ _ _ Patient seen and examined. I agree With the above note With the followrng additions: Please note extensive and excellent summary above This is a complex patient with IBD. Concern for possible other underlying mechanism for secondary gain??? in addition to a likely viral gastroenteritis as she has multiple sick contacts presenting with the same symptoms Of note, when I saw patient in consultation yesterday she appeared well and was conversing with her husband. Within seconds of arriving however she excused herself and went to the bathroom, at which point she would audibly dry heave. The husband made the comment that she was fine without any symptoms while he was visiting, until I had come by to examine her. The other exception was when my PA had visited with her earlier as well. As the patient has an outpatient Pain Management physician, she may resume her outpatient pain regimen once it is verified, but there do not appear to be objective findings on exam or on labs to justify an escalation in opiate therapy.

Suggested a zinc oxide based barrier but mother prefers Aquaphor. He has been having a lot of loose stools. Taking slightly less than normal by breast today, but just had a good feed. River was very fussy during assessment, with circular area of erythema around his rectum. Belly is soft when not crying. River has a reducible umbilical hernia and no inguinal hernias. I discussed goals of pain control with the parents, as River's pain appears very colicky in nature, but he is consolable. He will fuss for a few minutes, calm for a few minutes, and then start fussing again. This has placed considerable stress on the parents, as neither he or they are able to get much sleep. Parents do not want to use narcotic medications, would prefer to use the Tylenol and find the root cause of the discomfort. Discussed with the parents that likely a gastrointestinal infection is causing this gas and discomfort, given the increased WBC count; their concern is that the antibiotics are exacerbating intestinal discomfort. I explained that we needed to continue the antibiotics until cultures all negative 48 hours, still await results of stool cultures. Parents were very understanding. Offered any further assistance and will continue to monitor closely. Electronically Signed by Pisano,E|inor Elizabeth MD on 06/04/16 at 21 12 RPT #: 0604—0086 ***END OF REPORT***",OP

Flank pain Free Text A&P: This is a 17 yr old male with a sacral myelomeningocele, scarred right kidney. s/p tethered cord release in 4/2015, s/p bladder ileocystoplasty in 10/2015 with a history of multiple UTI's, multiple hospitalizations for culture proven UTI's who now presents with the usual right flank pain, cloudy urine and foul smelling urine. His right flank pain continues to be severe and he requires Dilaudid and Motrin for pain control. Page 6 of 7 , Patient: MASON,KENDAL Ul’lit# :HOOl33l657 Date: 08/28/16 ACCt# :HOO732580469 Problems include - UTI - await cultures to be resulted. However, since he was on Macrodantin and levaquin, the culture may remain negative. However, the CRP and ESR are negative - Z pyelonephritis. His CT scan shows no abscess that could explain any recurrent UTI this soon after his last hospitalization where he was dc'ed 8/20/16. Would keep him on the Meropenum. Appreciate help of ID - Dr. Garcia. Will stop the Gentamicin. Pain of right flank - Concern for his high level of pain. Currently raised up on dose of Dilaudid and Motrin. Have called pain management - await their input. While, his prior pain in his flank were accompanied by culture proven UTI's, he currentl pain may have a different source. Still await the urine culture. GI - 2 history of diarrhea. Will send off stool for C. diff, given his history of use of antibiotics. Will consult GI tomorrow to help with the identification of his flank pain. His CT scan did show some thickened loops of bowel with some dilated loops. Will check his chest x ray - AP and lateral to assess the source of pain. Discussed with Kendal, Dr. GArcia and pain management.

Father reported to PCP that patient seems to feel much better after Toradol. PCP reports that she and father discussed offering patient a placebo in place of a dose her Toradol, in attempt to observe for placebo effect. I spoke with father today and confirmed that he would like to try a placebo.
